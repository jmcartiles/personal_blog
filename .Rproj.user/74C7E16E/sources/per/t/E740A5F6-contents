This project pursues the improvement of tourism information to Lanzarote. A shiny web application is developed to collects data from [ISTAC](http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/) concerning demand and supply of tourism in Canary Islands and specially in Lanzarote. The data povided by the web application is related to arrivals, expenditure and occupation.

This project is leaded by [Centro de datos de Lanzarote](http://www.datosdelanzarote.com/) which is the departament of Island Council which provides with statistical information to Lanzarote and [Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria](https://www.ulpgc.es/) and funded by [Cabildo de Lanzarote](http://www.cabildodelanzarote.com/).

The work was done with Christian Gonz√°lez-Martel.
