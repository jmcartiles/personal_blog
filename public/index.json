Finally, it compares the current market share of tourism with the expected market share, which is estimated using a random parameter logit model. The study draws on data from EU-28 countries.

Its main advantage relies on its capability for measuring the social benefits, which represents a step further from traditional income cash flow. Social benefits also account for intangibles, such as externalities, or willingness to pay, which may be higher than market prices. At the same time, it accounts for social costs, which take into account the opportunity costs that do not need to be the same as paid costs. One common approach taken is comparing surplus changes before and after a project infrastructure investment. Surpluses are usually measured for consumers, firms, workers, tax-payers and other agents or entities, such as the environment. CBA usually focuses on the primary market and the surplus changes can be calculated for all of them with relevant case study information.\nHowever, if the infrastructure investment project has got implications on many sectors, the surplus calculations get more difficult to measure. Moreover, if the agents can obtain a benefit from the project implementation and it is translated into higher production, employment, capital rents or wages, an additional income effect is produced in other agents through additional consumption. In macroeconomic terms, the former effect is known as indirect effect, whereas the latter effect is known as induced effect. All these indirect and induced effects are usually missing in CBA.\nEconomic impact assessments (EIA) deal with macroeconomic impacts such as GDP or employment. A macroeconomic approach can be very useful for measuring the direct, indirect and the induced effects. Input-Output Analysis (IOA) employs sectorial matrices that relate all sectors in terms of inputs required to obtain certain outputs. It provides the key information to understand linkages among all sectors of the economy. Thus, the indirect effects can be measured. Additionally, Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) extend IOA to take into account income distribution. Thus, the induced effects can be measured. IOA and SAM show a static picture of the linkages of the economy, where constraints in resources are missing. In order to take into account such resource constraints, price and wage variations and its sensitivity, a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) can be implemented. It extends the SAM and it employs elasticities and macroeconomic equations to describe the economic relationships. It allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of the economy over time. For this reason, this research proposal suggests employing CGE to measure indirect and induced effects.\nThe challenge relies on how we can combine both tools. For instance, from a CBA perspective, an increase in GDP does not mean a homogeneous increase in social benefits. Moreover, an increase in employment is a positive output in EIA but a social cost in CBA terms. This research proposal tries to shed light on how this C-Bridge can be developed. The objective is twofold. On the one hand, a theoretical understanding of the bridge between CGE and CBA is pursued. On the other hand, empirical concerns are also considered, so that, at the end, divergence between CGE and CBA is identified and quantified depending on different market structure cases. The learning process consists of developing simple models which are controlled by alternative simulations. Later on, full models are also developed and simulations are run for three case studies.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"eb06b7073ce8d7e99d1ec9e5be523d89","permalink":"/project/cbridge/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cbridge/","section":"project","summary":"Linking CBA and CGE.","tags":["CGE","CBA"],"title":"C-Bridge","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"IGE The Galician Statistics Institute ( Instituto Galego de Estatística, IGE) is an autonomous body of the Xunta de Galicia created in 1988 and which is governed basically by Law 9/1988 on Statistics of Galicia.

It employs spatial bivariate correlations and spatial econometrics to understand the heterogeneous spatial relationship between established hotels and Airbnb for three kinds of local tourism destinations sun and beach, nature-based, and city. The case study concerns the Canary Islands where a good mixture of these attractions can be found. The main conclusion drawn is that Airbnb regulation needs to distinguish the kind of tourism. More precisely, Airbnb supply overlaps established hotels in city tourism, but it does not so clearly in sun and beach nor nature-based destinations. Airbnb supply matches tourist visits spatial distribution better than established hotels in city and nature-based destinations, but not in sun and beach destinations, where the incumbent hotels are closer to the tourism resources. Finally, the results from the spatial econometrics model shows that population size and the number of tourist visits matters as determinants of Airbnb location. However, the main determinant is price, which has got a much larger elasticity.","tags":["Airbnb","Peer-to-peer","Spatial correlation","Spatial econometrics","Tourism supply"],"title":"On the determinants of Airbnb location and its spatial distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"See some of the projects I have worked on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ISTAC The Canary Islands Statistics Institute ( Instituto Canario de Estadítica, ISTAC) is the central organ of the autonomous statistical system and official research center of the Government of the Canary Islands, created and regulated by Law 1/1991 of 28 January, Statistics of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.\nistacbaser The istacbaser R-package allows researchers to quickly search and download the data of their particular interest in a programmatic and reproducible fashion; this facilitates a seamless integration into their workflow and allows analysis to be quickly rerun on different areas of interest and with realtime access to the latest available data.\n","date":1511136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511136000,"objectID":"73c44ff04182a1d51752d6960ac07f30","permalink":"/project/istacbaser/","publishdate":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/istacbaser/","section":"project","summary":"Functions for searching and downloading data and statistics from the ISTAC API.","tags":["ISTAC","Open data","R","Software"],"title":"istacbaser","type":"project"}]
