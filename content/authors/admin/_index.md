I am Research Fellow at [Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria](https://www.ulpgc.es/), where I work on [C-Bridge](http://c-bridge.ulpgc.es/) project which pursues of building a bridge between Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE). It is project funded by [European Investment Bank](https://www.eib.org/en/index.htm). I am also member of the [Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Economics Research Group](http://eitt.es/).

Previously, I worked on tourism industry related businesses. In particular, at the Marketing & Social Media Department at [Binter](https://www.bintercanarias.com/), a regional airline, as Markets Researcher. Before, at the IT Department at [Grupo Satocan](https://www.gruposatocan.es/) and at [Patronato de Turismo de Gran Canaria](http://www.grancanaria.com/turismo/es/) in the Touristic Analysis and Air Connectivity Department.
