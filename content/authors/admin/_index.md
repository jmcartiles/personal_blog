I am Research Fellow at [Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria](https://www.ulpgc.es/), where I work on [MARCET II](https://marcet-mac.eu/wordpress/) project which pursues the promotion of whale watching ecotourism activity as a model of sustainable economic development. It is project funded by the European Union through the [European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/95/el-fondo-europeo-de-desarrollo-regional-feder-). I am also member of the [Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Economics Research Group](http://eitt.es/).

Previously, I worked on tourism industry related businesses. In particular, at the Marketing & Social Media Department at [Binter](https://www.bintercanarias.com/), a regional airline, as Markets Researcher. Before, at the IT Department at [Grupo Satocan](https://www.gruposatocan.es/) and at [Patronato de Turismo de Gran Canaria](http://www.grancanaria.com/turismo/es/) in the Touristic Analysis and Air Connectivity Department.
